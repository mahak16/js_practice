make a rectangle and when we move mouse on that rectangle on the left side we want to gradually change the color of that rectangle to red and when we move mouse to right side we want to change the color to blue.


steps to do:
1)sbse phele ye pata kro ki mouse rectangle pr aaya or move hua ya nai.
2) ab ye pta kro ki mouse center se left pr h ya right pr hai.
3)ab ye calac kro ki hum center se kitna left mai h, jitna left mai utni intensity se left ka color red badhao

ok so we should know a concept of rgb first, here rgb stands of red green blue. if the value of it is 0 tht is no color and value is of r is 255 then it is pitch red color(darkest red) and same with blue
